# Explain Clawdbot (Gemini Analysis)

This directory contains a breakdown of the **Clawdbot** framework, generated by Gemini agents for a beginner audience.

## Table of Contents

1.  [**What is Clawdbot?**](what-is-clawdbot.md)
    *   A plain English explanation of the project.
    *   Why it matters and who it is for.
    *   The "Lobster" analogy.

2.  [**How It Works (Technical Overview)**](how-it-works.md)
    *   The Architecture: Gateway, Channels, Agents.
    *   Data flow diagrams.
    *   Key concepts: Sandboxing and Plugins.

3.  [**Installation & Setup Guide**](installation.md)
    *   **Scenario A**: Standalone Mac Mini (Home Assistant).
    *   **Scenario B**: Isolated VPS (Secure Cloud Bot).
    *   Step-by-step instructions for both.

4.  [**Privacy & Security**](privacy-security.md)
    *   Data locality and ownership.
    *   The "Pairing" system for access control.
    *   Docker sandboxing for safe code execution.

5.  [**Configuration Reference**](configuration.md)
    *   `clawdbot.json` structure.
    *   Critical security settings.
    *   Environment variable overrides.

6.  [**Security Audit Report (2026)**](https://github.com/clawdbot/clawdbot/issues/1796)
    *   Analysis of 512 security findings by Argus Security.
    *   Key risks: Plaintext token storage, webhook signature bypass, and race conditions.
    *   Link to full remediation plan and active discussion.

7.  [**Independent Security Audit (Saad Khalid)**](https://saadkhalidhere.medium.com/why-clawdbot-is-a-bad-idea-critical-zero-days-found-in-my-audit-full-report-634602cb053f)
    *   **Critical RCE**: "Logic Bomb" allows agents to rewrite Docker startup commands via `config.patch`.
    *   **Auth Bypass**: Agents can self-approve dangerous commands (missing role check in `exec.approval.resolve`).
    *   **Data Risks**: Arbitrary file overwrite (`nodes:screen_record`) and arbitrary read (`logs.tail`).
    *   **Protocol Flaws**: Token manipulation via pipe injection and environment variable hijacking (`LD_PRELOAD`).
    *   *Note: The reported DNS Rebinding (SSRF) appears mitigated in the current version via pinned dispatchers.*
