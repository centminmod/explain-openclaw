# What is Clawdbot?

**Clawdbot** is a personal, private AI assistant that lives on your own computer, not in the cloud. Think of it as a "brain" that you own and control, which can talk to you through the apps you already use, like WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, and even iMessage.

## Why is this different?

Most AI assistants (like ChatGPT or Claude) run entirely on someone else's servers. You visit their website or use their app to talk to them.

Clawdbot is different because **you are the host**.

1.  **You Own the "Gateway"**: The core software runs on your hardware (a laptop, a Mac Mini, or a private server).
2.  **It Connects to *Your* Accounts**: It logs into WhatsApp or Telegram as *you* (or a bot account you control), bridging the gap between your chat apps and powerful AI models.
3.  **It Can "Do" Things**: Because it runs on your computer, it can run code, browse the web, manage files, and control your device—capabilities that cloud AI often restricts for safety reasons.

## Who is it for?

*   **Privacy Advocates**: You want an assistant that keeps your chat history and personal data on your own encrypted drive.
*   **Developers & Power Users**: You want an AI that can write and execute code on your machine to automate tasks.
*   **Home Lab Enthusiasts**: You have a Mac Mini or a Raspberry Pi/VPS and want to give it a "voice" that is always on and accessible from anywhere.

## In Plain English: The "Lobster" Analogy

Imagine a helpful, super-smart lobster living in your computer.
*   You text the lobster from the grocery store via WhatsApp: *"Remind me to buy butter."* -> It adds it to your list.
*   You ask it while driving via Telegram: *"Read me the latest news on AI."* -> It browses the web and summarizes it.
*   You ask it at your desk via Discord: *"Write a Python script to sort my downloads."* -> It writes the script and *actually runs it* to sort your files.

That lobster is **Clawdbot**.
