## Post-Merge Hardening (Feb 5 sync 2)

Four security-relevant commits:

- **`392bbddf2`** — Owner-only tools + command auth hardening (#9202): New `applyOwnerOnlyToolPolicy()` (`src/agents/tool-policy.ts:91-110`) gates sensitive tools (currently `whatsapp_login`) to owner senders only. Treats undefined `senderIsOwner` as unauthorized (default-deny). New `commands.ownerAllowFrom` config parameter for explicit owner identification. Defense-in-depth for tool access control (thanks @victormier).

- **`4434cae56`** — Harden sandboxed media handling (#9182): New `assertMediaNotDataUrl()` and `resolveSandboxedMediaSource()` (`src/agents/sandbox-paths.ts:66-98`) block data-URL payloads and validate media paths within sandbox boundaries. Enforcement moved to `message-action-runner.ts` for delivery-point validation. Prevents path traversal and sandbox escape via media parameters (thanks @victormier).

- **`a13ff55bd`** — Gateway credential exfiltration prevention (#9179): New `resolveExplicitGatewayAuth()` and `ensureExplicitGatewayAuth()` (`src/gateway/call.ts:59-89`) require explicit credentials when `--url` is overridden to non-local addresses. Prevents credential leakage to attacker-controlled URLs (CWE-522). Local addresses (127.0.0.1, private IPs, tailnet 100.x.x.x) retain credential fallback (thanks @victormier).

- **`385a7eba3`** — Enforce owner allowlist for commands: Hardens `commands.ownerAllowFrom` enforcement (`src/auto-reply/command-auth.ts:218-343`)—when explicit owners are configured, non-matching senders cannot execute commands even if `allowFrom` is wildcard.
