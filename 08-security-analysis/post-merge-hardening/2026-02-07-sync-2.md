## Post-Merge Hardening (Feb 7 sync 2)

One security-adjacent commit (reliability/hardening focus, continues cron race condition work from Feb 6 sync 3):

**LOW (1):**

- **`d90cac990`** (PR [#10776](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw/pull/10776)) — **Cron scheduler reliability, store hardening, and UX improvements:** Adds `isJobDue()` guard in `src/cron/service/timer.ts` to prevent stale timer firings. Reduces `MAX_TIMER_DELAY_MS` for tighter scheduling. Input normalization hardened in `src/cron/normalize.ts`. Store state initialization improved in `src/cron/service/store.ts` with migration support. 2,952 lines added across 58 files (mostly tests + UI). Continues cron race condition hardening from Feb 6 sync 3 (`1ecae8098`, `8e74fbb41`).

**Gap status: 1 closed, 3 remain open** (pipe-delimited token format, outPath validation, bootstrap/memory .md scanning) — see [Legitimate Gaps Status](../post-merge-hardening.md#legitimate-gaps-status).
