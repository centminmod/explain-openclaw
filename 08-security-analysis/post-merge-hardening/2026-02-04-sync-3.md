## Post-Merge Hardening (Feb 4 sync 3)

Three security-relevant commits:

- **`35eb40a70`** — fix(security): separate untrusted channel metadata from system prompt (#7872) (thanks @KonstantinMirin): New `src/security/channel-metadata.ts` isolates untrusted Discord/Slack channel topics from system prompt injection. Channel topic/purpose metadata moved from `GroupSystemPrompt` (instruction-bearing) to `UntrustedContext` (display-only with security warnings). Prevents channel admins from injecting instructions via topic/purpose fields.

- **`a749db982`** — fix: harden voice-call webhook verification: Significantly enhanced webhook verification in `extensions/voice-call/src/webhook-security.ts` (+270 lines). Added provider-specific validation for Twilio and Plivo with comprehensive test coverage (134 new tests). Reinforces Audit 1 Claim 7 (webhook signature bypass) controls.

- **`6fdb13668`** — docs: document secure DM mode preset (#7872): Formalizes `session.dmScope: "per-channel-peer"` configuration for DM context isolation. Documents mitigation for cross-user context leakage in multi-sender DMs.
